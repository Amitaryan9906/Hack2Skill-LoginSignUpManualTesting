# Description:
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive manual testing suite for the UI/UX and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) of the login and sign-up functionalities on the Hack2Skill website. The manual testing process aims to ensure that these critical user interactions are smooth, intuitive, and error-free, providing an optimal experience for the end-users.

## Testing Scope:
The scope of this testing effort is limited to the following areas:
1. User Login Functionality
2. User Sign-Up Functionality

## Test Objectives:
The key objectives of this manual testing are to:
1. Validate the user login process for existing users.
2. Verify the user sign-up process for new users.
3. Ensure that the user interface is visually appealing and user-friendly.
4. Confirm that all relevant fields and elements are properly displayed and functional.
5. Identify and report any UI/UX inconsistencies, layout issues, or design flaws.
6. Execute User Acceptance Testing to ensure the website meets user expectations.

## Testing Tools
The testing will be carried out using manual methods without any automated testing tools. Testers will use various browsers and devices to simulate real-world usage scenarios.

## Testing Environment
The testing environment will comprise a staging version of the Hack2Skill website, which is a replica of the production environment. Testers will have test accounts to simulate different user roles and scenarios.

## Testing Approach
1. **Test Planning:** Define the testing scope, objectives, and testing resources. Identify the different user roles for testing.

2. **Test Case Design:** Create detailed test cases covering all aspects of login and sign-up functionalities. Test cases will include positive and negative scenarios, boundary value tests, and cross-browser testing.

3. **Test Execution:** Execute the test cases on the staging environment using various browsers and devices. Testers will simulate different user scenarios to ensure thorough coverage.

4. **Defect Reporting:** If any issues are identified during testing, they will be reported on GitHub using the issue tracking system. Detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and screenshots will be provided for each issue.

5. **UAT and Feedback:** Involve real users or stakeholders in the User Acceptance Testing phase to gather feedback on the website's usability and user experience. Feedback will be incorporated into the testing process.

6. **Test Summary and Documentation:** Prepare a test summary report documenting the test results, including any defects found, actions taken, and overall assessment of the UI/UX and UAT. This report will be updated throughout the testing process.

## Collaboration and Contributions:
Contributors, testers, and developers can collaborate on this GitHub repository to share insights, report issues, and propose improvements. Regular updates and discussions will be encouraged to maintain transparency and enhance the overall quality of the Hack2Skill website.

### Note:
As this is a manual testing effort, it is crucial to regularly update the test cases and test results as the website evolves over time. Continuous monitoring and iterative testing will help maintain a high standard of UI/UX and user satisfaction.
